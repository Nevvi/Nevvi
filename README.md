Nevvi is a quick and easy to use application to create an opt-in notification group for broadcasting text messages. 

As an owner of a group all you have to do is create an account online, confirm your phone number, and tell us the
name of the group (e.g. Tyler's Wedding). From there you will receive a 5-digit code for your group which people
can subscribe to. As the owner you can monitor how many people are currently subscribed and, of course, send
messages to all of those who are listening.

This application is the UI that makes it all happen.
